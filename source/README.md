# Discordnim

A Discord library for Nim. 

Websockets from [niv/websocket.nim](https://github.com/niv/websocket.nim)

# Installing

This assumes that you have your Nim environment (including [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)) already set up, and that your Nim version is `0.18.0` or greater.
You can check your version with `nim --version`

```
nim -v
Nim Compiler Version 0.18.0 [Windows: amd64]
Copyright (c) 2006-2018 by Andreas Rumpf

git hash: 5ee9e86c87d831d32441db658046fc989a197ac9
active boot switches: -d:release
```

`nimble install discordnim`

# Usage

There are some examples in the `examples` folder.


Initialising a `Shard`:

```nim
import discordnim, asyncdispatch

proc someMessageCreateProc(s: Shard, m: MessageCreate) =
    if m.content == "ping":
        asyncCheck s.channelMessageSend(m.channel_id, "pong!")

let shard = newShard("Bot <your token>")

## Add your gateway event methods
discard shard.addHandler(EventType.message_create, someMessageCreateProc)
shard.compress = true # can be set to false if you don't want compressed websocket payloads

## Lastly you connect
waitFor shard.startSession()
```

All programs have to be compiled with the `-d:ssl` flag.

When compression is enabled you need a `zlib1.dll` present. Somewhere. I don't know where it should be placed.
